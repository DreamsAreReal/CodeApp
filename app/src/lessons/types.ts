/**
 * Lesson-as-data (rich, expert-density variant of docs/design/lesson-format.md).
 * ONE object drives three things at once: the animations (`segments[].scenes`),
 * the SRS card (`cards[]`, keyed to the backend review item), and the lesson
 * text (hook / mechanism explanations / sources). Add a lesson = add a file.
 *
 * Loop contract: the review item id on the backend is `${lesson.id}/${card.id}`,
 * so `lesson.id` and each `card.id` MUST match the backend seed (seed/lessons/*.json).
 *
 * COMPOSITE-QUOTE CONVENTION (accuracy guard): some verbatim quotes are stitched
 * from NON-adjacent sentences of the same source, joined by an ellipsis inside the
 * guillemets, e.g. «first clause… later clause». These are FROZEN as-is. A future
 * author MUST NOT extend such a composite (adding another «…» hop can silently
 * diverge from the source). Each lesson file that contains composites carries a
 * `// COMPOSITE-QUOTES:` marker block listing them by field locator; grep the repo
 * for `COMPOSITE-QUOTES` to find every one. Do not paraphrase or lengthen them —
 * re-verify against `source.archived` (the pinned Wayback snapshot) instead.
